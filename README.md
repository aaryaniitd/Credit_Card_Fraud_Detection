# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A simple solved problem to understand different classification models.

I have used the famous problem of **Credit Card Fraud Detection** in Data Science domain to take a look at the ***practical* differences in 3 classification models** and also see the implementation of a very basic **Neural Network**.

In the main file named *"credit-card-fraud.ipynb"* I have given description of all the steps I have done and in the end explained the difference in the 3 models I selected for comparison. The 3 models I selected were the very famous: **Decision Tree, Random Forest and Extra Trees Classifiers** from sklearn library.

The original data file was larger than the limit Github offers, so I have used a sample file to showcase the data. You can download the original dataset from [Here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

I have written what is best of my knowledge, if you find any errors then please let me know or you can send a push request directly.
